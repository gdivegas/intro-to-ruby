There are different kinds of errors that can occur when we run our Ruby programs. Let's force an error. Make a new file called `errors.rb`. Inside, put:

```ruby
puts "hello".uppercase
```

```
errors.rb:1:in `<main>': undefined method `uppercase' for "hello":String (NoMethodError)
```

Let's parse through this error to figure out what it's saying. 

Take time to read each Error. They often tell you how to fix the issue. Even if you don't understand them right away, they can be a great starting point when searching for help online.


<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try it: Reading Error Messages</h2>

<p>Try out the following lines of code, one at a time. Can you read the error message to figure out what the problem is?</p>

<p>puts hello</p>
<p>puts "hello</p>
<p>puts "hello "world"</p>
<p>puts "hello" + 5</p>
<p>put "hello"</p>
</div>
