<h2>Intros</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Instructor</li>
    <li>TAs</li>
    <li>Participants: Who are you? What should we know about you? What do you want to get out of this class?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Girl Develop It</h2>

<p>Girl Develop It is here to provide affordable and accessible programs to learn software through mentorship and hands-on instruction.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We are here for you!</li>
    <li>Every question is important</li>
    <li>Help each other</li>
    <li>Have fun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reminders</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Learning to code takes time -- it's ok to feel overwhelmed!</li>
    <li>You'll never "know everything"</li>
    <li>Help each other</li>
    <li>Ask questions</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are we doing today?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>We'll start by looking at the basic data types in Ruby: strings, integers, floats, arrays</li>
    <li>We'll also figure out how to take in and manipulate user input using control flow structures</li>
    <li>We'll end the day working on a pair project to write a Ruby script that posts to Twitter, reads timelines, and saves search results to files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IMPORTANT!</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that part of becoming a programmer is learning to solve problems and face challenges that you haven't faced before. Therefore, in parts of this class, you will see things that are unfamiliar. Don't be afraid! Try things out. Mess up. Learn. It's ok :) </p>
